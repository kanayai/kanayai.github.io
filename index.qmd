I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Statistics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath. I was research fellow at the Department of Statistics in the Open University in Milton Keynes and then Lecturer in Medical Statistics within the Tropical Epidemiology Group based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before coming to the University of Bath in September 2013.
